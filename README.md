## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

### Create and Activate Virtual Environment (Recommended)

It's recommended to use a virtual environment to avoid dependency conflicts:

<details>
<summary><strong>For Linux/macOS</strong></summary>

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>For Windows</strong></summary>

```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

</details>

### Install Requirements

Make sure your virtual environment is active, then install all required Python packages using:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

## Run Gazebo world Generator
1. Navigate to the `gazebo_terrian_generator` repository:
    ```bash
    cd gazebo_terrian_generator/scripts
    python server.py
    ```

2. To access application open up your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080`.
3. Gazebo world generated are stored inside `output/gazebo_terrian/` by default. Feel free to change the path defined in `scripts/utils/param.py` as per you choice.

## Spawning the gazebo world
1. Export gazebo resource path.
    ```bash 
    export GZ_SIM_RESOURCE_PATH=$GZ_SIM_RESOURCE_PATH:~/<your model path here>
    ```

2. Run Gazebo with the required world file.
    ```bash 
    gz sim <path of your  world file>
    ```


**Note:** Replace path with your actual path of the world file.


## Spawing sample worlds Example: 

1. Export the gazebo model path.
    ```bash
    GZ_SIM_RESOURCE_PATH=$GZ_SIM_RESOURCE_PATH:~/gazebo_terrian_generator/sample_worlds
    ```
2. Spawing gazebo world.
    ```bash
    gz sim prayag/prayag.sdf
    ```

## MapBox API key
A free api key is being used in the repo if it gets limited then please feel free to create your own API key from official [MapBox's website](https://www.mapbox.com/) and replace it in the [`configuration file`](scripts/utils/param.py)

## Important Disclaimer

Downloading map tiles is subject to the terms and conditions of the tile provider. Some providers such as Google Maps have restrictions in place to avoid abuse, therefore before downloading any tiles make sure you understand their TOCs. I recommend not using Google, Bing, and ESRI tiles in any commercial application without their consent.
